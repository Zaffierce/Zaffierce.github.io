## My about me - Jon Veach

Hi, I'm Jon.  I've spent the last 9 and a half years on Navy Active Duty as an IT and am now transitioning into the Programming field.  I've had a lot of great experiences in the military and learned some very valuable tools along the way, all while being able to travel and see places I thought I'd never see.  While I make the military sound super enjoyable and exciting, there are just as many bad experiences and lessons learned that come from it.  If you are stuck in life and don't know what to do, I'd recommend giving it a try.  It may just be that very thing that helps kick start you on to the next best thing.



### Japan - My home
![Japan](https://i.imgur.com/nSQYhTR.jpg)

For the past four years, I've lived on the outskirts of Tokyo and two years before that in northern Japan, aka the very cold Aomori Prefecture.  My time there was amazing and I enjoyed every minute of it, I met some fantastic friends, found I was interested in some hobbies I didn't think I liked and even found someone pretty special.  I did manage to pick up some Japanese along the way, but it needs a lot of improvement, fortunately I have a personal translator.

The first two years in in Tokyo were pretty lack-luster, I didn't do much at all and rarely adventured outside the walls of the base.  There's just something about going out into a foreign country where you can't speak or read their language and trying to enjoy yourself that scares the ever living shit out of you.  For many military members who go to Japan, this is a reality and it scares them from doing anything so the entire time they are there, they do nothing and then complain when they leave that Japan was horrible.  Fortunately for me though, my last two years there I met some pretty great people who forced me to go out and enjoy Japan for what it was.



### The little Jimny that could .... sometimes.

The off roading culture in Japan is fantastic.  Dirt bikes, Jimny's, Toyota FJs and Jeeps are the most common vehicle types you would come across out on your adventure, but the culture and community is the same across the board.  There are many courses located in the mountains of Japan but you don't have to go that far if you want to play, often you could just go down to the river and find people goofing off there.  Probably about 2 days after owning my Suzuki Jimny, I was approached by some guys on base who wanted to invite me out to the river.  I was skeptical because it was a bone stock Jimny on street tires, so I really wasn't expecting to do anything other than take this nice smooth road to the river.... but much to my surprise, the little bone stock Jimny was pretty great at off roading!  So that started a crazy spiral of upgrades and tinkering that filled a good chunk of my free time.  I got so invested into it that I started looking at what other Jimnys had and what I could add/change with mine to make it better and unique!  There's still so much more that I want to do, but here's everything I've done so far:  

- Upgraded the tires
- Upgraded the air intake system
- Completely changed the fuel system and hoses
- Upgraded the suspension to a 5" lift
- Upgraded brake lines
- Upgraded sway bars
- Changed front bumper
- Upgraded the tires again, to a much meatier set
- Performed some body "modifications" aka beat it with a hammer
- Changed rear bumper after some wiring modifications
- Installed plate bracket on back door and changed license plate location



### Learning how to live in Japan

![Japan]()

As I mentioned above, for the first two years in Japan I did pretty much nothing.  I was afraid to go out and adventure all because I couldn't speak the language and the last thing I wanted was to be stuck in the middle of no where and not be able to ask for help.  Well, as it turns out, I'm pretty stupid and restricted myself for no reason.  In Japan, English is taught at 5th grade [(future plans for as young as 3rd grade)](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/09/05/reference/english-heads-elementary-school-2020-hurdles-abound/#.XRGEBo97lPZ) and continues on through out your schooling.  Most Japanese can speak basic English while almost all of them can read it, and if you do ever run into any issues, [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=en&tl=ja) is a very great application which I used almost on a daily basis.  It can translate text, pictures and even voice.  Sometimes the translations are a little... interesting, but that's mainly due to how complex the Japanese language can be.  95% of the time you'll understand what you are translating, or at least get enough information to kind of fill in the rest of the blocks.
