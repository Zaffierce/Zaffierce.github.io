## My about me - Jon Veach

Hi, I'm Jon.  I've spent the last 9 and a half years on Navy Active Duty as an IT and am now transitioning into the Programming field.  I've had a lot of great experiences in the military and learned some very valuable tools along the way, all while being able to travel and see places I thought I'd never see.  While I make the military sound super enjoyable and exciting, there are just as many bad experiences and lessons learned that come from it.  If you are stuck in life and don't know what to do, I'd recommend giving it a try.  It may just be that very thing that helps kick start you on to the next best thing.


### Japan - My home

I lived a total of 6 years in Japan, 4 years on the outskirts of Tokyo and 2 years in the very cold Aomori Prefecture.  I did manage to pick up some Japanese along the way, but it's still very rough!  I enjoy off roading and the Japanese have a very amazing off roading culture that's super welcome and helpful.  Over there, it's almost a rite of passage if you roll your jeep or at least go on it's side.  But it's not all dangerous either, most often it's just a group of friends who all meet up at the river, have a nice BBQ and enjoy the sunshine, then go and see what we can climb or break!
