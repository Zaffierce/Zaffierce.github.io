## My about me - Jon Veach

Hi, I'm Jon.  I've spent the last 9 and a half years on Navy Active Duty as an IT and am now transitioning into the Programming field.  I've had a lot of great experiences in the military and learned some very valuable tools along the way, all while being able to travel and see places I thought I'd never see.

### Japan

```markdown
I lived a total of 6 years in Japan, 4 years on the outskirts of Tokyo and 2 years in the very cold Aomori Prefecture.  I did manage to pick up some Japanese along the way, but it's still very rough!  I enjoy off roading and the Japanese have a very amazing off roading culture that's super welcome and helpful.  Over there, it's almost a rite of passage if you roll your jeep or at least go on it's side.
